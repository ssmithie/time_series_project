## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to utilize time series analysis on restaurant sales, using additional exogenous variables, to predict daily sales.

## Data Collection <a name='data'></a>
I received 2.5 years of daily sales from two restaurants in Brooklyn. I also obtained weather data from [NOAA](noaa.gov).

## EDA
I began with some simple EDA, taking a look at the overall sales for the year:
